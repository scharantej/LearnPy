<h1>Python Lesson {{ lesson_id }}</h1>
<p>This lesson will teach you about the basics of Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p>
<h2>What is Python?</h2>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. This means that it is easy to read and write, and that it can be executed without having to be compiled first.</p>
<p>Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including web development, data science, and machine learning.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Python</h2>
<p>To get started with Python, you will need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website.</p>
<p>Once you have installed Python, you can open a Python shell and start typing code. The Python shell is a simple text-based interface that allows you to interact with the Python interpreter.</p>
<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
<p>The traditional first program that people write in any programming language is the "Hello, World!" program. This program simply prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<p>In Python, the "Hello, World!" program can be written as follows:</p>
python
print("Hello, World!")

<p>To run this program, you can type the following into the Python shell:</p>

python hello_world.py

<p>This will print the message "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
